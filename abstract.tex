The interference widely exists in Wireless Mesh Networks, e.g. gateway placement, 
channel assignment, and routing. Many work has been done to resolve the problems in WiFi network.
However, there is a gap between the hypotehsis and in-field spectrum utility. Moreover, the 
digitization of TV channels and new FCC regulations have reapportioned spectrum for 
data communication with far greater range than WiFi due to lower carrier frequencies.
Thus, leveraging the spectrum utility is a prerequisite for applying existing methodology 
and developing new algorithms. In this work, we propose measurement driven band selection 
framework which shows the opportunity of white space band in rural area and WiFi 
advantages in downtown area. We perform the framework with measured data in DFW Metropolitan 
and white space band outperforms percent in rural area and WiFi outperforms FIXME in downtown area.
