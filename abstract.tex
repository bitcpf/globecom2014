The FCC has reapportioned spectrum from TV white spaces for the purposes of 
large-scale Internet connectivity via wireless topologies of all kinds. 
The far greater range of these lower carrier frequencies are especially critical 
in rural areas, where high levels of aggregation could dramatically lower the 
cost of deployment and is in direct contrast to dense urban areas, in which 
networks are built to maximize spatial reuse.
