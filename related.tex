% Beamforming Tech
The primary function of antenna is to couple electromagnetic energy from one medium to another. 
Traditionally, omni antennas are used to radiate/receive energy equally to/from all directions
~\cite{bazan2012survey}.
Beamforming is a technique signals received at each antenna element are intelligently 
combined to improve the performance of the wireless system~\cite{winters2006smart}. 
Beamforming can increase signal range, suppress interfering signals, combat signal 
fading, and increase the capacity of wireless systems. 

% Beamforming Application need more
Beamforming has received a lot of attention recently in unicast~\cite{navda2007mobisteer} 
and multicast~\cite{sidiropoulos2006transmit,aryafar2013adam} applications.
These works focus on techniques improving the throughput, time reuse, or spacial
reuse. 
However, wireless networks are built 'by the people' and 'for the people'. Without
considering the demand of the clients, showing the benefit for the poeple, no technique
could be implemented in field.

% Network deployment
FCC has anounced to pursue WiFi coverage in sparse rural area~\cite{fccwhitespace}.
Several works have solutions appoaching the target through hetergeneous networks
~\cite{pcuiwinmee,wu2007delaunay}. These works focus on omni antenna technology, fail to 
discover the spacial reuse advantage of beamforming.
