Many efforts have been put in wireless network deployment issues, such as in gateway placement,
 channel assignment, routing and jointly optimization~\cite{he2008optimizing,ramachandran2006interference,akyildiz2006next}.
 These works focus on wireless network issues in WiFi bands and propose many algorithms 
 for the solving these problems.

However, as FCC regulations have reapportioned spectrum for data networks with white space bands, 
questions come out for wireless network with these new bands. Two new characters of wireless network
 are brought by white space bands: propagation difference and Inter-network interference.~\cite{cui2013leveraging,bahl2009white}.
 Previous work provide solutions for WiFi network but fails to cover these two factors.
 
 % White space band research
 White space band application is a new research hot spot. Follow FCC's policy, white spcae capacity 
 of  continental USA is quantified in~\cite{harrison2010much}. White space is targeting on opportunistic 
  medium access for data transmission and the opportunity is experimental verified indoor~\cite{obregon2010experimental}.
  However, the best application of white space is to serve rural area with its long propagation range
   other than indoor application. Our target is to quantify the opportunity of outdoor backhual network.

 % Network propagation difference
There are some works talked about the propagation variation in both WiFi network and white space network.
In~\cite{robinson2010deploying}, Robinson model the propagation variation in the same band for terrain 
demain. Rohan bring a databased-driven SenseLess framework for operating a white space network with 
database of primary user location, channel occupation~\cite{murty2012senseless}. 
However, as opportunistic medium access, the most important application of white space bands are 
focus on or related to the time domain. It is impossible to build a mathematical model of white 
space bands due to the variation of FCC rules 
in multiple metropolitan. Measurement is the best way to tell the current state of bands utility.
We propose the measurement framework with in-field data for wireless network deployment band selection.
