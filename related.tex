% Inter-network vs Intra-network interference
Many efforts have been put in wireless network deployment in WiFi bands~\cite{he2008optimizing,ramachandran2006interference,akyildiz2006next}.
These works focus on solving gateway placement, channels assignment, routing 
problems in wireless network issues to reduce the interference generated inside the network.
However, wireless interference is not only from a new deployment network but also from the
existing wireless device. Unfortunately, few of the works in network deployment notice the 
inter-network interference. There are some cognitive radio works discuss the inter-network
interference, but most of them focus on point to point communication other than network~\cite{cabric2004implementation}.

% White Space
As FCC adopt white space bands for wireless communication, questions come out 
for wireless network deployment~\cite{fccwhitespace}. The white spaces bring two
concerns: large propagation range and existing Inter-network interference from 
TV station and other device~\cite{cui2013leveraging,bahl2009white}.
Previous works fails to discover the white spaces benefit and drawback in network deployment~\cite{akyildiz2005wireless}.

The white spaces become new research hot spot in academy.
According the FCC's policy, the white space capacity of continential USA is quantified in ~\cite{harrison2010much}.
Many works correlated to white spaces are tareting on opportunistic medium access. The opportunity of white space
in point to point communication is experimentally verified in indoor environment~\cite{obregon2010experimental}.
However, the application of white space in outdoor environment, such as urban, rural area, has not been recognized.
Lacking the quantization discussion of white space in outdoor environment is blocking the development of white space
application.

 % Network propagation difference
There are some works discuss the propagation variation in both WiFi network and white space network.
In~\cite{robinson2010deploying}, Robinson model the propagation variation at the same band in terrain 
domain. Rohan brings a databased-driven SenseLess framework designing a white space network with 
database of primary user(TV station) location, channel occupation~\cite{murty2012senseless}. 
However, as far as we know, no work jointly discuss the influence of white space on network deployment in 
propagation variation of space domain and spctrum utility in time domain.
